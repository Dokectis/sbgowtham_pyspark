This repository is based on the original code I found on The Data Tech YouTube channel. 
You can find the channel using the following URLs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOopRpPH7N4 and https://github.com/sbgowtham/pyspark/tree/main. 

The video I watched was "10 PySpark Product-Based Interview Questions". 

My purpose for using this repository is to practice answering the interview questions on my own. Any changes I make to the original code are purely for learning purposes.
